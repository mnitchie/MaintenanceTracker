# Paper is Evil

I don't like having to sift through paper records to find how long its been since I changed my timing belt or how 
old my brake pads are. I don't like that new mechanics have no idea what was done to the car in the past. I don't
like buying (or selling) a car and having to track down paper records or rely on someone's word. Car maintenence 
records should be electronic. They should be searchable and sharable, and keeping track of the details should be
easy and intuitive.
